Created Todo application with
React.js and Redux
Used Mocha.js for testing each component

This has been one of a challenging applications for me as before learning redux i created all the functions holding different features only with React and had tests written with Mocha.js

After learning redux and iterating each and every functions using Actions, Reducers and Store it was hard to re-implment each component as it was before. Not only this, it was hard to iterate 25+ tests written by mocha.js as well.
